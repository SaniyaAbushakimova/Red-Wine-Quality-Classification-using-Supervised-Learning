## Project_1

Project 1 completed on March 17, 2022.

**Project Type**: Exploratory Data Analysis 
### Purpose
- Understand the relationship between the quality of red wine and its chemical properties
- Answer the following research questions:
  - *What is the difference between low-quality and high-quality red wine in mean acidity, which include fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, and pH?*
  - *Does alcohol have a positive correlation with red wine quality?*
  - *What is the proportion of high-quality red wines whose alcohol concentration is larger than the average? What is the proportion of low-quality red wines whose alcohol concentration is lower than the average?*

## Project_2

Project 2 completed on May 8, 2022.

**Project Type**: Classification problem
### Purpose
- Construct a classification task that will predict the quality of red wine based on its chemical properties.

### Machine Learning tools
- Selected models (Logistic Regression, K-NN, Kernelized SVM, Random Forest);
- Evaluation Metric (Accuracy, F1, Precision, Recall);
- Hyperparameter tuning;
- Checking for overfitting;
- Error Analysis (ROC curves, Confusion Matrix, Feature Importance).
